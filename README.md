# DQN_MsPacman

Implementation of a DQN agent able to play MsPacman using PyTorch and ALE environment, following DeepMind paper "Human Level Control Through Deep Reinforcement Learning" (2015). In addition, two variations of DQN are implemented: Double DQN and Clipped Double DQN.

To test the trained models (loading the saved neural networks weights "state_dict_model.pt", "double_state_dict_model.pt", "clipped_state_dict_model.pt") open the notebook and run all cells wituout the one that calls the "train_agent" function.
