# DQN_MsPacman

Implementation of a DQN agent able to play MsPacman using PyTorch and ALE environment, following DeepMind paper "Human Level Control Through Deep Reinforcement Learning" (2015).

To test the trained model (loading the saved neural network weights "state_dict_model.pt") open the notebook and run all cells wituout the one that calls the "train_agent" function.
